      albumInfo: '‘Dimension Intrusion’ was the first full-length studio album by Richie Hawtin, who was 22 years old at the time and living in Windsor, Canada. It was first released in June 1993 under the F.U.S.E. name on Hawtin’s own Plus 8 Records imprint and again as the second release of Warp Records seminal ‘Artificial Intelligence’ series.<br/>The album compiled previously released F.U.S.E. EPs from Plus 8 complemented with new music specially recorded for this release. It would be a fundamental album for the young producer, who was experimenting with different themes and techniques to find his very own sound. Largely inspired by sci-fi movies he used a collection of synthesizers and drum machines, playing with their electronic yet warm sound effects and in turn discovering some of his favorite instruments.<br/><br/>The tracks on ‘Dimension Intrusion’ range from club focused techno to soundtrack ambience and can be seen retrospectively as experiments leading to what would soon become Hawtin’s trademark acid laced Plastikman sound.<br/><br/>It was on this album that he first collaborated with his brother, Matthew Hawtin, presenting an original painting completed in 1992 as the album artwork. In fact the album title was derived from this painting’s title ‘Dimension Intrusion’, demonstrating the reciprocal inspiration shared between the brothers. The acrylic painting oscillates between the one and two-dimensional. The composition of geometrical beams in bold primary colors and sharp lines evokes electrically charged movement and progression in and out of different dimensions. The visual tension corresponds with the energetic rhythms of the music, further more, the abstract painting and techno music share machine-like precision whilst producing a sensual and emotionally triggering experience.<br/><br/>‘Dimension Intrusion’ is an iconic album in the history of electronic music that sets Richie Hawtin on a path of exploration and interest in the connection of audio and visual expression.'

      albumInfo: 'Alongside the success of ‘Dimension Intrusion’ Hawtin released a remix EP with varying permutations of ‘Train-Trac’. This release, only on Warp Records, contained reinterpretations of the original track which combined his love of stripped down Chicago Acid House and percussion driven Detroit Techno. The throbbing industrial sound and urgency of the original track are replaced with metallic percussion, giving the remixes new momentum and sophistication.<br/><br/>The idea of a racing train, its technology driven force and vocation of pushing forward was a representation of what still motivates Hawtin. Through a relentless pursuit of progress and innovation he drove his music production forward and became a integral part in Detroit’s developing underground party scene.<br/><br/>Accompanying this journey was the artwork ‘Different Planes of Atmosphere’ (1992) by his brother Matthew, an expressive painting that depicts a kaleidoscopic composition of hard-edged geometrical forms and shapes across a large format canvas surface. The wedges, bolts and circles are at once flat due to their monochrome coloration and at the same time burst out into every direction, out from the picture plane and into three-dimensional space. Representing explosive energy and impulse for innovation, the painting became an illustration of the creative force within the artists.'

      albumInfo: 'Initially recorded in late 1993 as a follow-up to ‘Dimension Intrusion’, it is only now that the album with the futuristic name ‘Computer Space’ finally sees the light of day.<br/><br/>‘Computer Space’ was the product of an exploratory recording session Hawtin took in the fall of 1993. On his perpetual quest of doing something different and unheard of, he experimented with the Roland TB-303 and Akai S950 sampler to take the sound of acid further than he had before. Richie found freedom in creating music devoid of beats, inviting more space to permeate his compositions and allowing hauntingly cerebral and sensual sounds to take the lead. In this respect ‘Computer Space’ was an important transition leading him to ‘From Within’ and Plastikman.<br/><br/>The album title and cover artwork is based upon a silkscreen print his brother Matthew produced in 1993. ‘Computer Space’ resembles the familiar setting of ‘Dimension Intrusion’ with its blue planes and yellow beams that are projecting deep into the picture sphere, penetrating the monochrome vastness. The image is as reduced and spacious as the sound of the album, pointing significance towards the void and focused composition.<br/><br/>Center stage of the image is the confrontation of a vibrant red cube and a human brain. The implied telepathic communication between the two becomes manifest in the music of this album.<br/><br/>The release of ‘Computer Space’ as part of the ‘Dimensions’ box set establishes a deeper understanding for Richie’s creative arc during his formative years, learning and honing his sound while always searching for new dimensions in which to explore. Precision, reduction and progression are enduring themes and driving forces for the creative works of both brothers, which is apparent in this trilogy. '
